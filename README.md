# Entropy-Gradient based Odd-Even classifier
This project implements an odd-even binary classifier using entropy-gradient updates rather than the usual gradient descent algorithm. A custom training loop is also used here instead of the built-in optimizer of TensorFlow. So, the whole project is implemented mainly using the NumPy library.
